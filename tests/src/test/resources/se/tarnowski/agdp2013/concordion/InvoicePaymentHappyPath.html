<h1>An invoice is paid with the correct amount</h1>

<p>An unpaid invoice is marked as paid if an invoice payment is received with the exact same amount
    as on the invoice. The invoice's payment date is set to the day the payment was received. </p>

<div class="example">

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>Given that customer <span concordion:set="#customerName">Sven</span> has an unpaid invoice.</p>

    <p>
        When a payment with invoice number <span concordion:set="#invoiceNumber">12345678</span> is processed.
        <span concordion:execute="#result = processPayment(#customerName, #invoiceNumber)"></span>
    </p>

    <p>Then the status of the invoice should be <span concordion:assertEquals="#result.paymentStatus">PAID</span></p>

    <p>And its payment date should be set to <span concordion:assertTrue="#result.isPaymentDateToday">today</span>.</p>
